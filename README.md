# The plan

To interactively exhibit a self-designed/built modular synthesiser somewhere on the 42 campus

- We will use the 84HP TipTop audio case we have in the lab
- People should be able to connect via two or more pairs of wired headphones

# The story so far

Here are the modules that we already built or will will send for shortly:

- ASCII 8-Bit Waves			10HP
- Daisy seed delay			6HP
- Daisy seed delay			6HP
- Higawo Kick				6HP
- Higawo Hat/Noise			6HP
- Higawo Clock Divider			6HP
- Higawo Mixer				6HP
- MS-20 filter				8HP

This gets us to 54HP

# Probably we need

- VCA's
- Modulation (LFO's)
- Quad headphone amp
