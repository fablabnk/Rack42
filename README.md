# The plan

Rack42 is a project by [42 Berlin SynthLab](https://discord.gg/Nnb8dGzZ). The aim is to interactively exhibit a modular synthesiser system on the ground floor of the campus of 42 Berlin(https://42berlin.de/). The end goal is two 42HP systems, each with a separate headphone amp, so that two people can jam/play together. We are currently working on this project weekly during our Wednesday evening SynthLab Sessions at [FabLabNK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UQUkKKDwy35rFFZc6)

# Current status 

- Four modules have been built so far (marked below as COMPLETE)
- Eight modules are currently in progress, with PCBs and components ordered
- We are using an old 90HP case for development and all modules already have laser cut panels which have been placed inside (see photo) TO ADD
- The next stage is assembly/testing/revision of each of the new modules
